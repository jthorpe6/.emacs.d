#+title: .emacs.d

I've don whole literate configuration, and I've also done the having multiple =.el= files. Now I've gone back to one huge file with all my config in it. 

* Installation

#+begin_src shell :results output
  git clone https://github.com/jthorpe6/.emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d/
#+end_src

I also have some handy =aliases= for running =emacs=

#+begin_src shell :results output
  alias ec='emacsclient -nw -c -s ~/.emacs.d/server/server'
  alias ecc='emacsclient -n -c -s ~/.emacs.d/server/server'
  alias emacs='emacs --daemon'
#+end_src
